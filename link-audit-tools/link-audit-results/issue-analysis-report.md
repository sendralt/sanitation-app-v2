## Recommended Fix Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Authentication Fixes (Immediate - 1-2 days)
1. **Fix Admin Authentication** - Investigate and resolve admin login failures
2. **Fix User Authentication** - Resolve user role login issues
3. **Resolve Rate Limiting** - Fix compliance role HTTP 429 errors

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Fixes (1-3 days)
1. **Password Reset System** - Implement working forgot password functionality
2. **Session Management** - Fix manager dashboard session issues
3. **Form Submission Logic** - Correct form action redirects

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1 day)
1. **Re-run Complete Audit** - Verify all fixes work correctly
2. **Cross-Role Testing** - Ensure no regression issues
3. **Performance Testing** - Verify rate limiting is appropriate

## Technical Recommendations

### Authentication System
- Review Passport.js configuration
- Check user seeding and database connectivity
- Validate session middleware setup
- Implement proper error logging

### Rate Limiting
- Review express-rate-limit configuration
- Implement role-based rate limiting
- Add proper error handling for rate limit responses

### Password Reset
- Configure email service (nodemailer/sendgrid)
- Implement secure token generation
- Add proper error handling and user feedback

### Session Management
- Review express-session configuration
- Implement consistent session timeout handling
- Add session validation middleware

## Monitoring and Prevention

### Ongoing Monitoring Setup
1. **Automated Daily Audits** - Schedule link checker to run daily
2. **Health Check Endpoints** - Implement comprehensive health checks
3. **Error Logging** - Add detailed logging for authentication failures
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Track response times and error rates

### Testing Integration
1. **CI/CD Integration** - Add link audit to deployment pipeline
2. **Regression Testing** - Automated testing for critical user flows
3. **Load Testing** - Verify rate limiting under normal load

## Next Steps
