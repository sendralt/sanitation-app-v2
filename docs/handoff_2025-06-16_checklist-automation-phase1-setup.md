# Hand-off Document: Checklist Automation & Tracking - Phase 1 Setup

**Date:** 2025-06-16

**Project/Feature:** Advanced Checklist Assignment Automation & Tracking System

**1. Overview**

The main objective is to enhance the existing sanitation checklist application by:
*   Introducing automated checklist assignments.
*   Implementing comprehensive tracking and analytics using a new PostgreSQL database.
*   Developing role-based dashboards and BI capabilities.
Crucially, the current workflow of saving checklist submissions as JSON files (used for an existing supervisor email validation process) must be retained. User authentication will continue to be managed by the separate `dhl_login` application and its SQLite database. The new PostgreSQL database will serve as an enriched data store primarily for the new advanced features.

**2. Task Handed Off & Completion Status**

The current task is **Phase 1: Core PostgreSQL & Basic Tracking - Initial Setup & Submission Integration**.

*   **Completed:**
    *   Defined PostgreSQL connection environment variables in `backend/.env.example`.
    *   Installed the `pg` (Node.js PostgreSQL driver) package within the `backend` service.
    *   Created `backend/config/db.js` to manage PostgreSQL connection pooling.
    *   Imported the database configuration into `backend/server.js`.
    *   Created an initial database schema script `backend/db/init_schema.sql` defining core tables: `ChecklistSubmissions`, `SubmissionHeadings`, and `SubmissionTasks`.
    *   Modified the `POST /submit-form` endpoint in `backend/server.js` to write submitted checklist data to these PostgreSQL tables, in addition to the existing behavior of saving to JSON files.
    *   Created a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root to facilitate running a PostgreSQL service in Docker.

*   **Current Status & Pending Actions for Next Developer:**
    *   **Blocked:** The primary blocker is the setup of the Docker and PostgreSQL environment on the development machine. The code modifications for writing to PostgreSQL have been implemented but cannot be fully tested until the database is accessible.
    *   **Next immediate actions for the incoming developer are environment setup and initial testing.**

**3. Significant Code Modifications & New Files**

*   **New Files Created:**
    *   `docker-compose.yml` (Project root): For defining and running the PostgreSQL Docker service.
    *   `backend/config/db.js`: Handles PostgreSQL connection pooling and configuration.
    *   `backend/db/init_schema.sql`: SQL script to create the initial tables in the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   `backend/.env.example`: Added placeholder environment variables for PostgreSQL connection (`PG_HOST`, `PG_PORT`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `PG_DATABASE`).
    *   `backend/server.js`:
        *   Imported the PostgreSQL database configuration from `backend/config/db.js`.
        *   The `POST /submit-form` endpoint was significantly updated to include logic for:
            *   Connecting to PostgreSQL using the connection pool.
            *   Starting a database transaction.
            *   Inserting records into `ChecklistSubmissions`, `SubmissionHeadings`, and `SubmissionTasks` based on the received `formData`.
            *   Committing or rolling back the transaction.
    *   `backend/package.json` and `backend/package-lock.json`: Updated due to the installation of the `pg` package.

**4. Next Actions for Incoming Developer**

1.  **Install Docker:** Install Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux) if not already present.
2.  **Configure PostgreSQL Environment:**
    *   Review and customize `docker-compose.yml` if necessary (e.g., PostgreSQL version, default user/password - though these are placeholders to be overridden by `.env` for the app).
    *   Create or update `backend/.env` by copying from `backend/.env.example`. **Crucially, populate `PG_HOST`, `PG_PORT`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `PG_DATABASE` with the details for the PostgreSQL instance you intend to use (either local native or Docker). Also, update `JWT_SECRET`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`.** For Docker via `docker-compose.yml` as provided, `PG_HOST` will be `localhost`, `PG_PORT` `5432`, and `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `PG_DATABASE` should match what's set in the `environment` section of the `docker-compose.yml` for the `postgres_db` service.
3.  **Start PostgreSQL Container:**
    *   Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
    *   Run `docker-compose up -d` to build (if necessary) and start the PostgreSQL container in detached mode.
    *   Verify the container is running using `docker-compose ps` or Docker Desktop.
4.  **Initialize Database Schema:**
    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL instance running in Docker (e.g., using `psql` or a GUI tool like pgAdmin/DBeaver).
    *   Execute the `backend/db/init_schema.sql` script against the `sanitation_checklist_db` database (or the name you configured).
        *   Example using `psql` from host (if `psql` is installed locally):
            `psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U your_pg_user -d sanitation_checklist_db -f backend/db/init_schema.sql`
        *   Example executing `psql` inside the container:
            `docker cp backend/db/init_schema.sql dhl_sanitation_pg_container:/tmp/init_schema.sql`
            `docker-compose exec postgres_db psql -U your_pg_user -d sanitation_checklist_db -f /tmp/init_schema.sql`
            (Replace `your_pg_user` and `sanitation_checklist_db` with values from your `docker-compose.yml`).
5.  **Run Application & Test Submission:**
    *   Start the `dhl_login` application.
    *   Start the `backend/server.js` application.
    *   Perform a checklist submission through the frontend UI.
    *   **Verify:**
        *   The JSON file is created in `backend/data/`.
        *   The supervisor email is sent correctly.
        *   Data is accurately inserted into the `ChecklistSubmissions`, `SubmissionHeadings`, and `SubmissionTasks` tables in your PostgreSQL database.
        *   Check the console logs of `backend/server.js` for any database-related errors or success messages.
6.  **Proceed with Phase 1 - Supervisor Validation & Logging:**
    *   Add `SupervisorValidationsLog` and `AuditTrail` table definitions to `backend/db/init_schema.sql` and update the database schema.
    *   Modify the `POST /validate/:id` endpoint in `backend/server.js` to write supervisor validation data to these new PostgreSQL tables (alongside updating the JSON file).
    *   Implement basic `AuditTrail` logging for new submissions and supervisor validations.

**5. Identified Bugs, Blockers, or Technical Debt**

*   **Blocker:** The immediate blocker is setting up the Docker/PostgreSQL environment. The implemented code for PostgreSQL interaction in `backend/server.js` has not yet been live-tested.
*   **Technical Debt/Areas for Refinement:**
    *   The current PostgreSQL insertion logic in `/submit-form` assumes `formData.original_checklist_filename` is provided; it falls back to `formData.title`. This should be robustly handled or the frontend contract clarified.
    *   Error handling for the dual-write (JSON file + PostgreSQL) in `/submit-form` currently logs database errors but allows the email sending to proceed if the JSON save was successful. This behavior might need review based on how critical the PostgreSQL write is deemed for the initial submission flow.
    *   Comprehensive audit trailing and the full automation engine are planned for subsequent phases.

**6. Architectural Notes & Assumptions**

*   **Dual Data Storage:** Checklist data is intentionally stored in two forms:
    1.  JSON files in `backend/data/` (primary for the existing supervisor email validation workflow).
    2.  Structured data in PostgreSQL (for new features: automation, advanced tracking, BI, dashboards).
*   **User Authentication:** Remains handled by the `dhl_login` application (using SQLite). The `backend/server.js` application trusts JWTs issued by `dhl_login`.
*   **User Data for Checklist System:** For Phase 1, `userId` and `username` from the JWT are stored in PostgreSQL with submissions. More detailed user attributes (like roles for automation or dashboards) will be fetched via API calls to `dhl_login` as needed in later phases.
*   **Checklist Structure in PostgreSQL:** Data is parsed from the submitted JSON (which is derived from HTML) for each new submission and stored relationally.
*   **No Historical Data Migration:** PostgreSQL will start fresh; existing JSON files from `backend/data/` will not be migrated into PostgreSQL in this phase.

**7. Pertinent Documentation**

*   **Project Proposal:** [`docs/checklist_automation_proposal.md`](docs/checklist_automation_proposal.md) (contains the detailed plan approved prior to this implementation phase).
