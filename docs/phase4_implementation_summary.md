- **Tracking:** Maintains assignment history and counts in `RoundRobinTracking`
- **Failover:** Handles missing users and role changes gracefully

### 2. Scheduled Automation
- **Engine:** Node-cron for reliable scheduling
- **Default Jobs:**
  - Daily cleanup (2 AM) - Mark overdue assignments
  - Weekly compliance reports (6 AM Monday) - Generate reports
  - Daily reminders (9 AM weekdays) - Send notifications
  - Hourly checks (8 AM-5 PM weekdays) - Monitor pending tasks

### 3. RPA Integration
- **Workflow Types:**
  - **NOTIFICATION** - Assignment alerts and notifications
  - **ESCALATION** - Overdue task escalation management
  - **TICKET_CREATION** - Automated support ticket creation
  - **COMPLIANCE_REPORT** - Compliance report generation and distribution
- **Webhook Support:** External RPA systems can receive real-time events
- **Event Triggers:** Assignment creation, validation failures, compliance violations

## üìä Compliance Dashboard Features

### Main Dashboard (`/compliance`)
- **Real-time Metrics:** Overall compliance score, validation trends
- **Quick Access:** Links to detailed reports and audit trails
- **Visual Design:** Professional compliance-focused interface

### Compliance Metrics (`/compliance/metrics`)
- **Filtering:** By time period and checklist type
- **Breakdowns:** By checklist type, daily trends, validation performance
- **Export Ready:** Data formatted for reporting

### Audit Trail (`/compliance/audit`)
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All system activities and user actions
- **Advanced Filtering:** By date, action type, user
- **Compliance Focus:** Designed for regulatory requirements

### Non-Compliance Reports (`/compliance/non-compliance`)
- **Drill-down Capability:** Specific failure analysis
- **Severity Classification:** High/Medium/Low based on frequency
- **Actionable Insights:** Common failure points identification
