## Workspace-specific rules

### General Guidelines for Programming Languages

1. Clarity and Readability
   - Favor straightforward, self-explanatory code structures across all languages.
   - Include descriptive comments to clarify complex logic.

2. Language-Specific Best Practices
   - Adhere to established community and project-specific best practices for each language (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.).
   - Regularly review language documentation and style guides.

3. Consistency Across Codebases
   - Maintain uniform coding conventions and naming schemes across all languages used within a project.

### Task Execution & Workflow

#### Task Definition & Steps

1. Specification
   - Define clear objectives, detailed requirements, user scenarios, and UI/UX standards.
   - Use advanced symbolic reasoning to analyze complex scenarios.

2. Pseudocode
   - Clearly map out logical implementation pathways before coding.

3. Architecture
   - Design modular, maintainable system components using appropriate technology stacks.
   - Ensure integration points are clearly defined for autonomous decision-making.

4. Refinement
   - Iteratively optimize code using autonomous feedback loops and stakeholder inputs.

5. Completion
   - Conduct rigorous testing, finalize comprehensive documentation, and deploy structured monitoring strategies.

#### AI Collaboration & Prompting

1. Clear Instructions
   - Provide explicit directives with defined outcomes, constraints, and contextual information.

2. Context Referencing
   - Regularly reference previous stages and decisions stored in the memory bank.

3. Suggest vs. Apply
   - Clearly indicate whether AI should propose ("Suggestion:") or directly implement changes ("Applying fix:").

4. Critical Evaluation
   - Thoroughly review all agentic outputs for accuracy and logical coherence.

5. Focused Interaction
   - Assign specific, clearly defined tasks to AI agents to maintain clarity.

6. Leverage Agent Strengths
   - Utilize AI for refactoring, symbolic reasoning, adaptive optimization, and test generation; human oversight remains on core logic and strategic architecture.

7. Incremental Progress
   - Break complex tasks into incremental, reviewable sub-steps.

8. Standard Check-in
   - Example: "Confirming understanding: Reviewed [context], goal is [goal], proceeding with [step]."

### Advanced Coding Capabilities

- Emergent Intelligence
  - AI autonomously maintains internal state models, supporting continuous refinement.
- Pattern Recognition
  - Autonomous agents perform advanced pattern analysis for effective optimization.
- Adaptive Optimization
  - Continuously evolving feedback loops refine the development process.

### Symbolic Reasoning Integration

- Symbolic Logic Integration
  - Combine symbolic logic with complexity analysis for robust decision-making.
- Information Integration
  - Utilize symbolic mathematics and established software patterns for coherent implementations.
- Coherent Documentation
  - Maintain clear, semantically accurate documentation through symbolic reasoning.

### Code Quality & Style

1. Type Safety Guidelines
   - Use strong typing systems (TypeScript strict mode, Python type hints, Java generics, Rust ownership) and clearly document interfaces, function signatures, and complex logic.

2. Maintainability
   - Write modular, scalable code optimized for clarity and maintenance.

3. Concise Components
   - Keep files concise (under 500 lines) and proactively refactor.

4. Avoid Duplication (DRY)
   - Use symbolic reasoning to systematically identify redundancy.

5. Linting/Formatting
   - Consistently adhere to language-appropriate linting and formatting tools (ESLint/Prettier for JS/TS, Black/flake8 for Python, rustfmt for Rust, gofmt for Go).

6. File Naming
   - Use descriptive, permanent, and standardized naming conventions.

7. No One-Time Scripts
   - Avoid committing temporary utility scripts to production repositories.

### Refactoring

1. Purposeful Changes
   - Refactor with clear objectives: improve readability, reduce redundancy, and meet architecture guidelines.

2. Holistic Approach
   - Consolidate similar components through symbolic analysis.

3. Direct Modification
   - Directly modify existing code rather than duplicating or creating temporary versions.

4. Integration Verification
   - Verify and validate all integrations after changes.

### Testing & Validation

1. Test-Driven Development
   - Define and write tests before implementing features or fixes.

2. Comprehensive Coverage
   - Provide thorough test coverage for critical paths and edge cases.

3. Mandatory Passing
   - Immediately address any failing tests to maintain high-quality standards.

4. Manual Verification
   - Complement automated tests with structured manual checks.

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

1. **Prioritize Server Logs**: The server log is the source of truth. Address the specific error it reports before exploring other hypotheses.

2. Root Cause Resolution
   - Employ symbolic reasoning to identify underlying causes of issues.

3. Targeted Logging
   - Integrate precise logging for efficient debugging.

4. Research Tools
   - Use advanced agentic tools (Perplexity, AIDER.chat, Firecrawl) to resolve complex issues efficiently.

### Security

1. Server-Side Authority
   - Maintain sensitive logic and data processing strictly server-side.

2. Input Sanitization
   - Enforce rigorous server-side input validation.

3. Credential Management
   - Securely manage credentials via environment variables; avoid any hardcoding.

### Version Control & Environment

1. Git Hygiene
   - Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages.

2. Branching Strategy
   - Adhere strictly to defined branching guidelines.

3. Environment Management
   - Ensure code consistency and compatibility across all environments.

4. Server Management
   - Systematically restart servers following updates or configuration changes.

### Documentation Maintenance

1. Reflective Documentation
   - Keep comprehensive, accurate, and logically structured documentation updated through symbolic reasoning.

2. Continuous Updates
   - Regularly revisit and refine guidelines to reflect evolving practices and accumulated project knowledge.
