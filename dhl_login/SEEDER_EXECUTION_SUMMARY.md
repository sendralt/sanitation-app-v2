# Create compliance user
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed add-compliance-user.js

‚úÖ **Total Users**: 2 users in database
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Seeders properly check for existing users

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Default Admin Password**: The admin user was created with the default password `password123`. This should be changed immediately in production environments.

2. **Environment Variables**: For production deployment, set these environment variables:
   - `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Custom admin password
   - `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` - Custom admin username (optional)
   - `INITIAL_ADMIN_SEC_ANSWER1` - Custom security answer 1
   - `INITIAL_ADMIN_SEC_ANSWER2` - Custom security answer 2

3. **Password Hashing**: All passwords and security answers are properly hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12.

## User Login Credentials

### Admin User
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/login-page
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password123`

### Compliance User
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/login-page
- **Username**: `compliance`
- **Password**: `Compliance123!`

## Next Steps

1. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to start the frontend on port 3000
2. **Test Login**: Verify both users can log in successfully
3. **Change Default Passwords**: Update admin password for security
4. **Production Setup**: Configure environment variables for production deployment
